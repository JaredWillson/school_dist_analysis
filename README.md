# PyCity Schools Analysis

## Observations

In analyzing the provided data for the city's schools there were several obvious trends that came across:

- There is a strong correlation between per capita school spending and student performance, but it isn't the obvious one. Schools that spend more had worse results than those that spend less. See the "scores by school spending" analytics below. Scores were consistently higher in schools with lower funding per student. Note this is correlation, not causation... It is likely that differences in school population would account for this discrepancy, not the actual variation in funding. However, one might reasonably infer that better funding does not necessarily result in better performance in standardized testing
- Charter schools have a much higher success rate based upon standardized testing than district schools. See the section on "scores by school type". Note, in particular, that all of the five best performing schools are charter schools, and all of the worst performing schools are district schools.
- There is no obvious trend in terms of student performance improving or deteriorating as students progress from one grade to the next.
- Small and medium sized schools had very similar results, but large schools had significantly worse results than small and medium schools.

## Limitations

There are some significant limitations that might cause strong correlations without necessarily indicating causation. For example, student populations are almost certainly not randomly distributed across the schools. Charter schools have a more rigorous curriculum that may not attract students with weaker academic performance, thus charter schools are likely starting with a stronger set of students. In addition, special needs students of various types may be forced to choose district schools because availability of services which might skew per capita funding numbers. There may also be differences in the afluence of different parts of the city, thus creating additional divisions in student population. While the correlations are very strong, I would caution anyone to be very cautious about assuming causation.

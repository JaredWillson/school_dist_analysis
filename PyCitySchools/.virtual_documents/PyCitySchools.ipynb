# Calculate the total number of unique schools
# ---------------------------------------------
# Decided to use the new school_data_complete dataframe to perform the calculations
# even though it would have been simpler to just count the rows in the school_data
# since no 'unique' qualifier would have been required.  This approach seemed more
# in line with the intent of the assignment--analyzing data by slicing and dicing

school_count = len(school_data_complete['school_name'].unique())
school_count


# Calculate the total number of students
# --------------------------------------
# Since there is exactly one student per row in the school_data_complete dataframe
# The number of rows in the dataframe is also the number of students.
# I confirmed this by both counting the rows, and by checking the unique
# student ID's contained in the dataframe using the following:
#
# student_count = len(school_data_complete['Student ID'].unique())
# 
# Since the result was the same, I used the simpler code below.

student_count = len(school_data_complete)
student_count


# Calculate the total budget
# -----------------------------
# The total budget is simply the sum of the individual school budgets.
# In our school_data_complete dataframe, the school budget is repeated on each student's 
# row, so a simple solution is to group by the school names, then grab the first row
# from each group by and sum up the 'budget' column totals.
# Again, this would be easier to do just using the school_data dataframe, but that
# didn't seem in keeping with the intent of the exercise.

total_budget = school_data_complete.groupby(['school_name']).first().sum().loc['budget']

# Calculate the average (mean) math score
# ---------------------------------------
# Since each row in the school_data_complete dataframe represents exactly one student,
# The average is obtained by just calculating the mean of the 'math_score' column

average_reading_score = school_data_complete['reading_score'].mean()
average_reading_score


# Use the following to calculate the percentage of students who passed math (math scores greather than or equal to 70)
# -----------------------------------------------------
# I made one change to the supplied cod... I substituted 'Student ID' for 'student name'. I did this because
# ID's are much more likely to be unique than names. In practice, for this particular calculation, it makes
# no difference to the final result since even duplicate names would be counted, but it seemed a better pracie
# in case we were using something like .unique rather than .count
